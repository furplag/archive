/**
 * Unbending Promise is useful for retrying an operation that may sometimes fail for transient reasons .
 * it can be used to stop the retry loop whenever you want and exit the loop gracefully before the limit is reached . 
 * this can be achieved by setting the 'abort' parameter to true .
 *
 * @function unbendingPromise
 * @param {Function} fn - a function to retry, it should return a promise that resolves to a boolean indicating success or failure .
 * @param {string} [beacon] - an optional identifier to identify the process being retried
 * @param {number} [limit=100] - the maximum number of attempts to retry the function before it is rejected
 * @param {number} [delay=100] - the delay in milliseconds between retries
 * @param {boolean} [abort=false] - a flag that when set to true, will cause the promise to reject immediately .
 * 
 * @returns {Promise} - a promise that will resolve when the provided function returns true . the promise will retry with a delay 
 * if the provided function returns false, and it will be rejected if the limit is reached or the abort flag is true .
